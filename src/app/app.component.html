							Heroku’s HTTP Routing routes each request through a layer of reverse proxies which are, among other things, responsible for load balancing and terminating SSL connections. This means that requests received by a dyno will have the last router’s IP address in the REMOTE_ADDR environment variable, and the internal request will always be made using the HTTP protocol, even if the original request was made over HTTPS.
							Like most common load balancers or reverse proxies, Heroku provides the original request information in X-Forwarded-… headers (as documented here). Laravel uses components from the Symfony framework for HTTP request handling, and Symfony can easily be configured to trust such headers.
							Since Heroku sends all requests to an application through a load balancer first, and that load balancer always sets the headers (making it impossible for a client to forge their values), you can configure Laravel to treat the current remote addresses (which is the Heroku router) as a trusted proxy.
							You can use the fideloper/proxy package to automate this procedure. After following the installation instructions, you will need to slightly adjust the config/trustedproxy.php configuration file so that it trusts all proxy addresses.
							It is very important to also prevent Laravel from trusting the Forwarded and X-Forwarded-Host headers, because Heroku’s router does not set those, but Symfony’s Request component trusts them out of the box once a trusted proxy is set.
							The final configuration file should look like this:

							Changing the log destination for production
							By default, Laravel will log errors and messages into a directory on disk, which isn’t ideal, because Heroku uses an ephemeral filesystem and treats logs as streams of events across all running dynos.
							In order to ensure that errors, should they arise, are visible in heroku logs, the corresponding configuration in config/app.php must be changed:
